# Project Description

 - A very simple program that follows the principle of a simple shell, it reads stdin, parses the command, and executes with execvp.
 - Before it executes, it forks the process.

## TODO

- [ ] Adding cd as a built-in command 
- [ ] Interpreter sign doesn't work, fix that
- [ ] In the main file, the function usage is wonky, find a better way around that
- [ ] Provide more comments to easily explain the program
